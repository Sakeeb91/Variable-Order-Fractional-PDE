# Contributing to Variable-Order Fractional PDE Discovery

We welcome contributions to this research project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the codebase.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Variable-Order-Fractional-PDE.git
   cd Variable-Order-Fractional-PDE
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter standard)
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Code Formatting

We use automated code formatting:

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Check linting
flake8 src/ tests/
```

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all functions and classes using Google style
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Document any new mathematical formulations
- Add comments for complex algorithms

Example docstring format:
```python
def fractional_derivative(u, alpha, dx):
    """Compute fractional derivative using GrÃ¼nwald-Letnikov formula.
    
    Args:
        u (torch.Tensor): Input function values
        alpha (float): Fractional order
        dx (float): Spatial step size
        
    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Fractional derivative approximation
        
    References:
        Pang et al. (2019). fPINNs: Fractional Physics-Informed Neural Networks.
    """
```

### Testing

- Add unit tests for new functions in `tests/`
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/
  ```
- Aim for >80% code coverage for critical components

### Mathematical Accuracy

- Verify numerical implementations against analytical solutions
- Include convergence tests for new algorithms
- Document numerical stability considerations
- Validate against established benchmarks
